# Agent Control Hooks Configuration
# ===================================
#
# This file defines agent↔model bindings for the hook system.
# When this file exists and has at least one enabled agent binding,
# the hook system activates for runs using those agent IDs.
#
# When this file is missing, empty, or disabled, the hook system
# is completely disabled and existing behavior is unchanged.
#
# Usage:
#   - To enable agent mode: Copy this to config/agents.yaml and customize
#   - To disable agent mode: Delete config/agents.yaml or set enabled: false
#
# Model IDs use LiteLLM format (e.g., "openai/gpt-4", "anthropic/claude-3-opus")

# Global enable flag - set to false to disable all hooks
enabled: true
